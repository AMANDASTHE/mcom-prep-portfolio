# Week 1 Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1. Overview
This project explores a real-world dataset to build foundational EDA skills required for the MCom in Statistical Sciences. It covers data cleaning, descriptive analysis, visualization, and identification of initial insights that motivate modelling.

## 2. Research Questions
- What is the structure and distribution of key variables?
- What data quality issues exist (missingness, outliers)?
- What patterns or relationships emerge between variables?
- What directions for modelling or hypothesis testing arise?

## 3. Dataset
The dataset for this project is stored in the `data/` folder.
A data dictionary will be created after initial inspection.

## 4. Methods
- Summary statistics
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Visualization (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots)
- Bivariate exploration
- Correlation analysis

## 5. Folder Structure
- `data/` – raw and cleaned data
- `notebooks/` – exploratory notebooks
- `src/` – any helper scripts
- `reports/` – markdown/PDF summaries and exported visuals

## 6. Results Summary
(To be updated at the end of the project.)

## 7. Next Steps
- Begin preliminary modelling
- Conduct feature engineering
- Prepare for Week 2: statistical inference foundations
